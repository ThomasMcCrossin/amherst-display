## Quick Start

### For Yodeck Display

1. **Add to Yodeck:**
   - Create new Web Page widget
   - URL: `https://thomasmccrossin.github.io/amherst-display/`
   - Set refresh interval: 10 minutes
   - Configure display duration as needed

2. **Done!** The display will auto-update with fresh data every 10 minutes.

### For Development

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThomasMcCrossin/amherst-display.git
   cd amherst-display
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variable (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   export RAMBLERS_ICS_URL="https://your-hockeytech-calendar-url.ics"
   ```
   Without this, the fallback `data/ramblers.ics` file will be used (which may be outdated).

4. **Build Data:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/build_all.mjs
   ```

5. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   # Serve with any static server, e.g.:
   npx http-server -p 8080
   # Visit: http://localhost:8080
   ```

## GitHub Actions Setup

### Required Secret

To ensure fresh schedule data, set the following repository secret:

1. Go to: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**
2. Name: `RAMBLERS_ICS_URL`
3. Value: Your HockeyTech calendar ICS URL (e.g., `https://lscluster.hockeytech.com/...`)

### Workflow Schedule

The automated build runs:
- **Daily at 6:30 AM UTC** (3:30 AM Atlantic / 2:30 AM EDT)
- **On manual trigger** (Actions tab → "Build display JSONs" → Run workflow)
- **On code changes** to scripts or data files (for testing)

### Manual Trigger

To force an immediate update:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **"Build display JSONs & standings snapshots"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"** → **"Run workflow"**

## Key Design Decisions

### Amherst Ramblers Headshots Served from API

**Why:** To avoid storing player photos in the GitHub repository (privacy/licensing concerns).

**How:** The `headshot_url` field points directly to HockeyTech's API:
```json
{
  "player_id": "mhl-3545",
  "name": "Christian White",
  "headshot_url": "https://assets.leaguestat.com/mhl/240x240/3545.jpg"
}
```

**Other Teams:** Headshots are still downloaded and cached in `assets/headshots/` for non-Amherst teams.

### Static JSON + GitHub Pages

All data is pre-generated as static JSON files, making the display:
- ✅ **Fast:** No server-side processing
- ✅ **Reliable:** Works even if APIs are down
- ✅ **Scalable:** Can handle any traffic
- ✅ **Free:** Hosted on GitHub Pages

### Daily Updates Only

The system updates once per day (3:30 AM) to avoid:
- ❌ Hitting rate limits on scraped websites
- ❌ Excessive GitHub Actions usage
- ❌ Unnecessary commits

**Trade-off:** Data may be up to 24 hours old (acceptable for this use case).

## Troubleshooting

### Display Shows "No upcoming games"

**Cause:** Schedule data is outdated or ICS file has old dates.

**Fix:**
1. Check that `RAMBLERS_ICS_URL` secret is set correctly
2. Manually trigger GitHub Actions workflow
3. Verify `games.json` has future dates: `cat games.json | grep start`

### GitHub Actions Not Running

**Cause:** Workflow schedule may be disabled or repo is archived.

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab → Check for disabled workflows
2. Enable workflow if needed
3. Manually trigger a test run

### Standings/Rosters Empty

**Cause:** Network failures during scraping, or website structure changed.

**Fix:**
1. Check **Actions** tab → Latest run → View logs
2. Look for errors in standings.mjs or rosters.mjs steps
3. Update selectors in `scripts/standings.mjs` if website changed

### Player Headshots Not Loading

**Cause:** HockeyTech API URLs changed or CORS issues.

**Fix:**
- For Amherst Ramblers: Check `headshot_url` in `rosters/amherst-ramblers.json`
- For other teams: Verify files exist in `assets/headshots/{Team-Name}/`

## Customization

### Change Display Settings

Edit `CONFIG` in `index.html`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  DAYS_AHEAD: 7,                  // Show games for next N days
  HOME_ONLY: true,                // Show only home games
  HOME_VENUES: ["Amherst Stadium"], // Filter by these venues
  REFRESH_MINUTES: 10,            // Auto-refresh interval
};
```

### Add/Remove Teams

Edit `teams.json`:

```json
{
  "slug": "new-team",
  "name": "New Team Name",
  "aliases": ["New Team", "Team Alias"],
  "logo_url": "assets/logos/mhl/new-team.png",
  "league": "MHL"
}
```

### Modify Styling

All CSS is inline in `index.html` for easy customization. Look for the `<style>` section.
